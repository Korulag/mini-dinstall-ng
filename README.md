# mini-dinstall-ng

An unofficial mini-dinstall replacement with focus on the following things:

 * Object oriented
 * Clean
 * Stable
 * Extendable

It's not like I dislike the current mini-dinstall but I think it's easier 
to keep control over the code if we keep it clean and understandable.

## Configuration

Differences to mini-dinstall
----------------------------
* More options. See [the options section][General Options] for more information.
* If you want to define architectures in the section DEFAULT
  you have to name the option "arches" and not "architectures"
